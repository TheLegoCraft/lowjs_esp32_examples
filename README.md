Example projects for neonious one and low.js for ESP32


## What are the noenious one and low.js for ESP32?

*low.js for ESP32* is a port of Node.JS with far lower system requirements, low enough to run comfortably on the ESP32-WROVER module. With unit costs of under 3 $ for large amounts, the ESP32-WROVER module is a very cost effective solution for any (IoT) device requiring both a microcontroller and a Wifi connection.

low.js for ESP32 adds the additional benefit of fast software development and maintenance. The complete software stack of an IoT product (microcontrollers, websites, servers) can be based on the same software base. No specialized software developers are needed for the microcontroller software.

All of this becomes especially important if additional features will be added throughout the products life time via software update, which helps the product to stay leaders in their markets over time.

*neonious one* is both the reference board for low.js for ESP32, with an additional Ethernet port, additional Flash and an additional I/O controller, and a great hobbyist microcontroller board.
